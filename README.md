# CMPT 464 Final Project

## Roles

- **Iavor**: ML classificator
- **Maheep**: dataset parsing and data construction
- **Greg**: mesh correspondence and deformation
- **Vlad**: mesh correspondence and deformation

## Team information

- General Project Meeting - every Wednesday, 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm

## Timeline (2021)

- **March 31st** - Project Inception
- **April 7th** - Have dataset viewer ready to go
- **April 14th** - Crude and basic parts replacement, no scorer
- **April 21th** - Refined parts replacement, scorer to sort the models
- **April 26th, 12:30 pm** - Project defense and submission (submission deadline is at 11:45 pm).

## General Project Idea

- Pick random mesh and turn it into its corresponding parts.
- Replace each corresponding part for some other part from the collection.
- Process the new part (deform, grow, scale, etc.) to make sure the chair is connected and coherent.
- Create several chairs like these and rank them by using our scoring mechanism.

## Deliverables

### Dataset viewer (April 7th)

- First milestone, this will require several other parts in the works
- Basic UX: "explore" the dataset, able to choose any provided mesh, able to look at the mesh and then look at each of the particular parts constituting the mesh
- Basic UI: one set of arrows to move between the meshes and another set of arrows to move between the parts in a particular mesh (or anything else simple and effective)
- Requires mesh-parts association which in turn requires dataset processing

## Assignments/Tasks (in priority)

### Dataset parsing and preparation (Maheep)

- Input: our dataset
- Output: one big `.json` containing information about each mesh from the dataset
- Each mesh entry would have information from `/syms`, `/boxes`, etc. clapmed together in one spot
- For our project, we will need that `.json` and list of all `.obj`'s to do everything else

### Mesh data structure and mesh part generation (Maheep & Team)

- Input: the big `.json` and the `.obj`'s (basically our transformed dataset)
- Output: Generate parts `.objs` based on the dataset entry.
- Make sense of `.json` and construct representations which can be usable later on (e.g. here is a mesh and here is its parts, each part is labeled)

### Mesh correspondence and deformation (Vlad & Greg)

- Input: mesh1 and mesh2
- Output: mesh1 that occupies the same amount of space as mesh2
- Need to investigate whether we can just grow the bounding box, whether we need to find transformation or etc.
- General idea: find transformation from mesh1 and mesh2, apply that transformation to mesh1 and return
- MVP: find rigid transform
- Refined version: find non-rigid deformation

### Scorer (Iavor)

- Input: .obj
- Output: normalized score, 0-1
- In the end we will just integrate the trained model
- Convert meshes to voxel / SDF representation for analysis

## Ideas/Suggestions

- Probably need to set up a separate meeting with the Wallace to check in on the project
